Hi, I’m @moonshinexd, or Luna if your prefer it. <br>
I'm currently in the process of introducing myself in the vast world of TIC's cause it is what is needed in my workplace.<br>
So, I'm very interested in topics like SEO optimization, html and everything that will come aftherwards (english is not my mother language), tomorrow for example I will be diving in to photography rules.
Now, I do blogs, but my major was alternative and administrative towards tourism.

![Michin encapuchado sin fondo](https://github.com/moonshinexd/moonshinexd/assets/164962635/b54adc15-ab2d-4607-9d41-42a282f6d354) <br> just a michin that I like. 

<br>Anyways I'd rather people to not speak with me unless it has something to do with the things I'm learning about.
